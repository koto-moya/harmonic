A UI interface for database that leads with a conversational UI

## TODO:

- make an api interface for the application to use to interact with the server.  This way we don't need to mess with database permissions client side.  All database interaction can happen on server.  strict user verification on all queries

- make utilities for the app to hit against the endpoints defined in routers

- make login screen and connect the success signal to the hoempage.
